# Early-Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
In this work, diabetes prediction has been accomplished using the ML Classifier from the PID dataset. We select Random Forest as the best classifier based on accuracy and AUC for early prediction of diabetes.
> # Challenges
> The main challenge of this study is that most Bangladeshi hospitals still keep medical records in manual form, making it almost impossible to get a local dataset to test the model that was formed.

# Dataset Link
> [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database/).
